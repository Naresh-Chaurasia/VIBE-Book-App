You'll learn how to clap, helping you connect to music because clapping makes you an instrument in the band. You'll learn how to identify the structure of music, known as phrasing, helping you predict where the music is going and enjoy it more.",

        "text": "The way to start counting is simple: jump in and make mistakes. As you count, you'll often wonder if you're doing it right — stop and start over when needed. Listen for an accent or emphasis on count 1. Counts 1 and 5 often sound stronger or different than other beats.Count 1 may be louder or may simply feel different — listen for that 'something' rather than overthinking it. Some songs have accents on both count 1 and count 5, making them harder to distinguish. Listening for the transition between two major phrases helps — the end of one phrase sets up the beginning of the next.",

        "text": "Learning to clap helps you hear sets of 8, feel the beat, move better, and avoid clapping off-beat. The downbeat is on counts 1, 3, 5, and 7; the upbeat is on counts 2, 4, 6, and 8. You can clap on every beat, or only on the downbeats, or only on the upbeats depending on the rhythm you want to feel. If the 'tick' has emphasis, it can be written in all caps like boom TICK to show the difference between the beats. In an eight-beat pattern, the stomp represents the downbeat and the clap represents the upbeat, creating stomp CLAP cycles. Try variations: stomp+clap, stomp only, and clap only — each teaches your body a different part of the rhythm structure. A stomp–clap pattern can make you sound musical even without playing an instrument — it's a simple way to fake musical talent.",
