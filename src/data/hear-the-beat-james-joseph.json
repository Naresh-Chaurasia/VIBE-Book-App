You'll learn how to clap. This will help you connect to music, because clapping is like being an instrument in the band. You'll learn how to identify the structure of music. This is known as phrasing. This will start you on the path to better musicality, because it'll help you to predict where the music is going. It'll give you the somewhat useless skill of being able to predict and punch the air to a big accent or hit in the music (but I bet your friends will find that cool). There's more: according to the field of biomusicology, the study of biology and music, if you can predict where the music is going, you'll enjoy it more. Yup, lying on the couch and chilling to music is about to get better.",

These clues might include a new instrument that starts playing, a big crash, a drum fill or even just a significant change in the drum patterns. Electronic music loves to steadily add and subtract different parts every 32 counts, making it easy to recognize and work with those changes. ⤵️ Music can be abstract and there is often more than one correct answer to a phrasing question. You might get different teachers telling you to phrase differently. Just remember, you are dealing with the expression of ideas. Ideas change and are interpreted in different ways. ⤵️ But don't get hung up on trying to identify the phrasing of a song. Hearing the sets of 8 is the primary skill you need to learn.",

So, for example, the first major phrase could be four sets of 8 and the next one could be five sets of 8. Or maybe you get one that's only three sets of 8. Sometimes you get a 16-beat phrase (two sets of 8) and you wonder, does it stand on its own as a 16-beat phrase or bridge? Or does it belong to the major phrase before it? Don't worry about it. You may never know the answer. Just roll with it. If you're choreographing, do your own interpretation. Also, there's \"irregular phrasing,\" which is when a song has extra beats. It can be any number of beats but usually an even number. For example, you might get two or four beats placed between major phrases.",

If you stumble — if the count doesn't seem to be correct — stop and start over. For example, you might hear a big transition when you weren't expecting it.

Eventually, for me \"hitting the breaks\" ( from the punching exercise ) became my gateway to improving my spontaneous movement because breaks in music are easy to hear.",
